      <h3>What is it?</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4>

       <p> This is a simple model that's a member of a class of
       models of cognition and brain processes using methods known as
       "free-energy minimization", "prediction error minimization",
       "predictive coding" and/or "predictive processing".  The
       information below is probably not sufficient to provide an
       understanding of this model for someone who doesn't already have a
       basic understanding of related ideas.  The first couple of
       chapters of Andy Clark's <em>Surfing Uncertainty</em> (Oxford
       2015) provide an informal introduction.
       The simulation model described here is a fairly literal
       implementation of a mathematical model described in</p>

       <blockquote> Rafal Bogacz, "A tutorial on the free-energy
       framework for modelling perception and learning", <em>Journal of
       Mathematical Psychology</em>, available online 14 December 2015,
       ISSN 0022-2496, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2015.11.003.
       (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249615000759">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249615000759</a>)
       </blockquote>

       <p>This simulation model described here implements the scalar model that
       Bogacz presents in section 2 of his paper.  (There is another
       version of <a href="https://github.com/mars0i/free">this
       software</a> that implements the vector/matrix model that Bogacz
       describes in section 4.)</p>


      <h4>Levels and variables</h4>

       <p> In this model there are distinct "levels" of information that
       interact.  The general idea is that there is a "prediction"
       (represented by <em>phi</em>) at one level, scaled by a
       multiplier <em>theta</em>; the result is then is compared to some
       version of data (also called <em>phi</em>) at the at the next
       level down.  That is, we're in effect comparing a prediction from
       the higher level about what the data will be at the next level
       down.  The difference between these two values is an "error"
       value <em>epsilon</em>.  This is then scaled by the inverse of a
       value <em>sigma</em> to get a scaled error value.  And this is
       then used to adjust <em>theta</em> and the first <em>phi</em>.
       You can think of (<em>theta</em> &#10005; <em>phi</em> ) as an
       adjusted version of the "priors" level (the top level)
       <em>phi</em>: While the system originally assumes that the data
       will be a noisy version of <em>phi</em><sup>2</sup>, it tries to
       adjust <em>theta</em> so that the data is a noisy version of
       (<em>theta</em> &#10005; <em>phi</em> )<sup>2</sup>.</p>

       <p>Then the process starts over.  It's a feedback loop, with the
       proviso that if there are more three (or two--see below) levels,
       the process takes place between each two "adjacent" levels, so
       that the feedback loop involves all of the levels, each "talking"
       to the one below and the one above.</p>

       <p>However, the version of the model displayed in this web version of
       <em>free</em> has only three levels--or rather two, level 0 and
       level 1, since the last level, labeled "priors", isn't a proper
       level.  In the source code it's treated as a level, but it merely holds some values
       (parameters of priors) needed to make the model run in a simpler
       way, and Bogacz and other authors don't treat the specification of
       these priors as constituting a level.  
       (<em>free</em> is designed so that by changing or
       replacing one file--model.cljc for the web version--it should be
       able handle a model involving any number of levels.)</p>

       <h4>What's plotted?</h4>

       <p>This model assumes that noisy sensory data at level 0 is a function of the
       area of a circular object, whose radius is to be estimated at level 1.</p>

       <p>The chart initially plots four level-1 values over time.  The
       model's <em>phi</em> value is plotted over time by the black
       curve.  The red <em>epsilon</em> curve is the error--the
       estimated difference between the current estimate of the area and
       what the data is saying, roughly on average.  The blue curve
       represents the changing value of <em>theta</em>, which (by
       default) performs a long-term adjustment of a weight on the area
       estimate.  The green curve is for <em>sigma</em>, which is used
       to scale the error by dividing it by <em>sigma</em>.  This is
       adjusted in response to the current values of <em>epsilon</em>
       and <em>sigma</em>.  I currently have <em>sigma</em>'s minimum
       value set to 1, following a suggestion by Friston that Bogacz
       cites.  Timesteps are timesteps for the source code: Each timestep
       represents a new set of points.  You can think of each timestep
       as corresponding to a small number of milliseconds, though.
       (This is all pretty vague.  See Bogacz's article or my
       source file <a
       href="https://github.com/mars0i/free/blob/master/src/cljc/general/free/level.cljc">level.cljc</a>
       for details.)</p>


       <h3 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h3>

       <h4>Controlling the plot</h4>

       <p>The plot is controlled by the form below it.  The top part of the
       form allows you to adjust parameters of the plot itself.  The "re-plot"
       button will regenerated the plot after you change parameters.</p>

       <table>
       <tr><td><em>Levels to display</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>Display which levels?</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>timesteps</em>:</td>		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>How many timesteps to display?</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>width</em>:</td>		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>How wide should the plot be?</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>height</em>:</td>		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>How tall should the plot be?</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>num-points</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>How many points should be plotted?</td></tr>
       </table>

       <p>You can tell the application to plot more or fewer
       <em>timesteps</em>--as many as you want, as long as your browser
       can get enough memory and your patience lasts.  The code will
       generate data for new timesteps as needed.  If you then reduce
       the number of timesteps, the existing data will be used; it won't
       be regenerated if you merely click on "Re-plot".  ("Re-run" will
       regenerate the data, however.)</p>

       <p>The "Levels to display" checkboxes control which levels are
       displayed--level 0 or level 1.  If you turn on level 0, you'll
       see the individual points of simulated sensory data as well as the
       <em>epsilon</em> values at level 0.  Note that the application
       will only plot as many points as you've specified, so you won't
       see all of the sensory data points unless you change
       <em>num-points</em> and <em>timesteps</em> to the same value.
       Plotting a lot of points might take a while--even if the underlying
       data has already been generated (see above); the plotting
       step takes time.  (Values other than the sensory <em>phi</em>
       will be plotted with a continuous line no matter how many or
       how few points are plotted.)</p>

       <p>You can also make the plot wider or taller within your browser
       window using <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>.

       <h4>Controlling the model</h4>

       <p>The bottom part of the control form contains parameters that
       affect the data generated by the model, rather than how and how
       much of the data is displayed.  The "re-run" button will regenerate
       the data if you've changed paramters.</p>

       <p>Parameters are divided into levels.  By default, every level
       has eight parameters, but some of these are ignored at the bottom
       and top/priors level, so they're hidden.  Also, at level 0,
       there are some additional "sensory" parameters that control the
       randomly generated sensory data.</p>

       <h5>Free energy minimization initialization parameters</h5>
       
       <p>The first four default parameters are:</p>

       <table>
       <tr><td><em>phi</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>initial data at this level</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>epsilon</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>initial error: difference between data at this level and the "prediction" from the level above</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>sigma</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>initial variance used to scale the error (inverse of precision)</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>theta</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>initial learning parameter</td></tr>
       </table>

       <p>The values in the form are just the initial values of
       these variables.  Their values will typically change as the 
       model runs; the changing values are what are plotted.  At higher
       levels, <em>phi</em> and <em>theta</em> are parameters of a
       "generative model" function whose value given those parameters is
       what's compared with the <em>phi</em> value at the next level
       down.  In theory, <em>theta</em> should change more slowly than
       <em>phi</em>, because it represents adjustment by long-term
       learning rather than immediate perceptual inferences, which is
       what the adjustment of <em>phi</em> provides.  In Bogacz's model,
       <em>theta</em> can only linearly scale the value of the
       generative function after its basic value is calculated from
       <em>phi</em>.</p>


       <h5>Integration increment parameters</h5>

       <p>The other four default parameters are:</p>

       <table>
       <tr><td><em>phi-dt</em></td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>epsilon-dt</em></td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>sigma-dt</em></td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>theta-dt</em></td></tr>
       </table>

	<p>These specify the rate at which the corresponding variables
	change.  For each of the four main variables <em>phi</em>,
	<em>epsilon</em>, <em>sigma</em>, and <em>theta</em>, an
	increment is calculated in each timestep, <em>and then</em> that
	increment is reduced by multiplying it by the corresponding
	<em>-dt</em> value.  The result of this multiplication is then
	added to the old value of the parameter to determine its new
	value in the next timestep.  A smaller value for a <em>-dt</em>
	parameter thus means that the corresponding data parameter will
	change more smoothly and more slowly, and will reflect to a
	lesser degree fluctuation in other parameters from which it's
	calculated.  Notice, For example, since <em>theta</em> is
	supposed to change more slowly than <em>phi</em>, I have
	<em>theta-dt</em> set to a smaller value than <em>phi-dt</em>.
	(However, it's interesting to see what happens when you adjust
	these values so that this relative size assumption is
	violated.)</p>


       <h5>Sensory data generation parameters</h5>

	<p>At level 0, there are also additional parameters that are
	specific to the way in which level 0 "sensory" data <em>phi</em>
	is generated on each timestep (in the version of model.cljc used
	in this web simulation).  This version of the sensory data
	generation uses one or more normal distributions, which may
	differ from one time period to another.  They can have different
	means and/or different standard deviations.

       <table>
       <tr><td><em>change-ticks</em>:</td>	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>Means and sd's will change after these intervals of time.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>means</em>:</td>		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>These means will be used one after another, starting over when they run out.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><em>stddevs</em>:</td>		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	<td>These standard deviations will be used, starting over, etc.</td></tr>
       </table>

       <p>For example, if the value of <em>change-ticks</em> is "500 100
       10", and the value of <em>means</em> is "2 20 5", then the
       sensory data will have a mean value of 2 for 500 timesteps, and
       then a mean value of 20 for the next 100 timesteps, followed by a
       mean of 5 for the next 10 timesteps.  Then the cycle starts over.
       If in addition, <em>stddevs</em> is "1 10 1", then the first and
       third distributions will have a standard deviation of 1, and the
       second will have a standard deviation of 10.

       <p>If you want a constant sensory distribution, list only one
       value each for <em>means</em> and <em>stddevs</em>, or set
       </em>change-ticks</em> to 0.</p>

       <p>Cyclic sensory data distribution changes provide a way of
       seeing the effects of changing distributions on <em>theta</em>,
       for example.  The effect is similar that from random changes in
       the sensory distributions, but is more easily observable and
       understandable because you know when the underlying input data
       will change.  (However, you could generate a random sequence of
       sensory changes using the current web version of free by
       generating sequence of random numbers and pasting them into the
       sensory data fields.  It's not hard to program the model to
       generate random changes, but that requires installing the full
       <em>free</em> package--see below).</p>

      <h3>Things to try</h3>

      <h3>Going further</h3>

      <p>It's possible to change things other than the parameters available
      for modification in the form.  For example, one might want to add
      more levels, or change the generative function, or change the
      sensory data generation.  At present, doing any of these things
      requires editing the Clojurescript source code, and recompiling
      the model.  To do this you need to install Clojure and install the
      entire <em>free</em> package from github.  Then you can run the
      model either directly in Clojure, or using Clojurescript, in a
      browser.  The way in which this is done is fairly easy if you're
      used to Clojure or Clojurescript.  I intend to provide
      instructions to help those unfamiliar with these languages get
      started modifying <em>free</em>, but might not have done so yet.</p>

      <p>It's also possible to enhance this web version to allow some of the
      preceding modifications from inside a browser, by editing and
      uploading bits of Clojurescript source code.  I haven't added this
      capability, but if you're interested in having it available, let me
      know.</p>
